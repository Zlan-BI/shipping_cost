# write a function that determins the lowest shipping cost. 
# Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
# Weight of Package	Price per Pound	Flat Charge
# 2 lb or less	$1.50	$20.00
# Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	$3.00	$20.00
# Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	$4.00	$20.00
# Over 10 lb	$4.75	$20.00
# Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you arenâ€™t charged for weight.
# Flat_charge = 125
# Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
# Weight of Package	Price per Pound	Flat Charge
# 2 lb or less	$4.50	$0.00
